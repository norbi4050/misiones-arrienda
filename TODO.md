# TODO - Properties Page Improvements

## Completed
- Fixed view mode state variable usage from `viewMode` to `view`.
- Forced default view mode to 'list' and updated UI toggle buttons accordingly.
- Added console logs for debugging property list rendering.
- Verified loading, error handling, and filtering logic remain intact.

## Next Steps
- Test the properties page in the development environment to verify the list view is the default and toggling works correctly.
- Verify that the map view renders correctly when toggled.
- Check console logs for property count and any errors.
- Review API response handling and fallback to mock data.
- Perform UI/UX testing for filter section and results display.
- Address any issues found during testing.
