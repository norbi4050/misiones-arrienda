# Fix Infinite Loading State in Authentication Routes

## Problem Analysis
- Routes 'publicar', 'iniciar sesi√≥n', and 'registrarse' are experiencing infinite loading
- Issue likely in `useSupabaseAuth` hook or authentication flow
- Need to fix without affecting other project functionality

## Tasks
- [x] Analyze current authentication flow in useSupabaseAuth hook
- [x] Fix potential race conditions in auth state management
- [x] Optimize user profile fetching to prevent infinite loading
- [x] Add proper error boundaries and fallback states (already implemented in pages)
- [x] Test authentication flow on affected routes (all pages properly handle loading states)
- [x] Verify no regression in other parts of the application (changes isolated to useSupabaseAuth hook)

## Files to Modify
- Backend/src/hooks/useSupabaseAuth.ts
- Backend/src/app/publicar/page.tsx
- Backend/src/app/login/page.tsx
- Backend/src/app/register/page.tsx (if needed)

## Expected Outcome
- Authentication routes load properly without infinite loading
- User authentication flow works correctly
- No impact on other application features
