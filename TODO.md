# Property Status Migration Plan

## Information Gathered
- **Current State**: Properties are being created with 'PUBLISHED' status but the API is filtering by 'AVAILABLE' status
- **Issue Found**: Inconsistent status values between creation and retrieval
- **Database Schema**: Uses 'PUBLISHED' as the active status for properties

## Plan
1. **Fix property creation endpoint** to use 'PUBLISHED' status ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Update property listing endpoint** to filter by 'PUBLISHED' status ✅ COMPLETED
3. **Remove invalid schema fields** (like 'isActive') ✅ COMPLETED
4. **Test the changes** to ensure properties are properly visible

## Files to be edited
- `Backend/src/app/api/properties/create/route.ts` - Fixed duplicate lines and removed invalid fields ✅ COMPLETED
- `Backend/src/app/api/properties/route.ts` - Updated filter to use 'PUBLISHED' status ✅ COMPLETED

## Followup steps
- Test property creation and retrieval
- Verify properties appear in listings
- Check for any remaining status inconsistencies
