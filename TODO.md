# TODO - Soft Guard Dashboard & Profile Image Upload

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Dashboard Soft Guard Implementation
- [x] Updated middleware.ts to use createServerClient and only sync cookies (no redirects)
- [x] Modified /dashboard to show CTA for unauthenticated users instead of redirecting
- [x] Authenticated users see normal dashboard content
- [x] Evidence: Entering logged in to /dashboard does not redirect to /login

### 2. Profile Image Upload Section
- [x] Verified "Mi perfil" link in header points to /profile/inquilino
- [x] Confirmed ProfileImageUpload component is present in profile page
- [x] Verified router.refresh() is called after successful PATCH in uploader component
- [x] Evidence: PATCH /api/users/profile 200 saves URL and refreshes header avatar

### 3. Configuration Updates
- [x] Updated next.config.js to remove redirects and add serverActions
- [x] Verified server-only profile page implementation

## ðŸ“‹ Technical Implementation Details

### Middleware Changes
- Replaced hard redirects with soft session synchronization
- Uses createServerClient for server-side auth checking
- No longer redirects unauthenticated users from protected routes

### Dashboard Soft Guard
- Removed automatic redirect to /login
- Shows user-friendly CTA for authentication
- Maintains session synchronization without forcing login

### Profile Image Upload
- Component already includes router.refresh() after successful save
- Properly handles file upload to Supabase Storage
- Updates user profile via PATCH /api/users/profile
- Cleans up old avatar files from storage

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Status
All requirements have been successfully implemented and tested. The system now provides a smooth user experience with soft authentication guards and proper profile image management.
