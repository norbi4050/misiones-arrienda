# Soft Guard Dashboard & Profile Image Upload - Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Dashboard Soft Guard Implementation
- **Middleware**: Already configured as "soft" - no redirects, only session synchronization
- **Dashboard Page**: Shows login CTA for unauthenticated users, normal content for authenticated users
- **Evidence**: Entering /dashboard logged in does not redirect to /login

### 2. Profile Image Upload Section
- **Profile Page**: /profile/inquilino already has ProfileImageUpload component
- **Image Upload**: Component handles PATCH /api/users/profile with router.refresh() after successful upload
- **Header Links**: "Mi perfil" in navbar and dropdown correctly point to /profile/inquilino
- **Evidence**: Profile page shows photo upload section, PATCH 200 saves URL, header refreshes avatar

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### Smoke Test Results
- ✅ /dashboard logged in → no redirect to /login
- ✅ Menu "Mi perfil" → shows photo upload section
- ✅ Upload image <2MB → saves to avatars/<uid>/… and PATCH 200
- ✅ Header refreshes and shows new avatar (via router.refresh())

## 📁 Files Involved
- `Backend/src/middleware.ts` - Soft middleware (no redirects)
- `Backend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Soft guard with CTA
- `Backend/src/app/profile/inquilino/page.tsx` - Profile page with image upload
- `Backend/src/components/ui/image-upload.tsx` - Upload component with router.refresh()
- `Backend/src/components/navbar.tsx` - Header with correct profile links
- `Backend/src/components/ui/profile-dropdown.tsx` - Dropdown with correct profile links

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented
1. **Soft Authentication**: No forced redirects, graceful degradation
2. **Session Synchronization**: Middleware syncs cookies without blocking
3. **CTA for Unauthenticated**: Clear call-to-action instead of redirect
4. **Image Upload Integration**: Profile page includes photo upload
5. **Real-time Header Update**: router.refresh() updates avatar after upload
6. **Consistent Navigation**: All "Mi perfil" links point to correct page

## 🚀 Ready for Production
All requirements have been met and the implementation is ready for testing and deployment.
